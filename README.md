FaRSA is an optimized library for solving l1-regularized convex optimization problem designed to be **efficient**, **flexible** and **user-friendly**.  l1-regularized convex optimization problem plays an important role in machine learning applications. An optimization framework [FaRSA](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2016/02/5331.pdf) has been proposed to efficiently solve such problem.  FaRSA implements highly optimized solutions for several widely used loss functions, like logistic loss, and supports generic loss function optimization.

## Documentation:

### 1. Quick Start 

In general, FaRSA contains a special optimized routine and a generic rountine. The special optimized routine provides highly optimized solutions for solving the below popular optimization problem:

- logistic loss 

- ...


Generic routine can support solving personalized objective functions.

In order to successfully call FaRSA to solve aimed problem, users are expected to finish the below steps:

- Configure FaRSA profile

- Prepare readable dataset if necessary

- If aim problems do not belong to FaRSA's existed problem solutions, for C users, modify **client.c** based on aimed problem.

Once the above steps are complete, run the below command in terminal to call FaRSA for solving aimed problem:

	./farsa -p path_to_param_profile

Results would be displayed in terminal.



### 2. Configure FaRSA Profile

To employ FaRSA on aimed problem correctly, you need to define a FaRSA profile. Two demos of profiles have been provided in the FaRSA source folder, named FaRSA1.profile, FaRSA2.profile. 

There are two type parameters in general: basic and advanced. 

- Basic parameters are necessary for successfully running the FaRSA. 

- Advanced parameters are designed for experienced users to control parameters in optimization algorithm.

The format in profile is 

	parameter1 : value1
	parameter2 : value2
	parameter3 : value3
	...


#### 2.1 Basic Parameters 

- **objective_function_type** : Objective function type for choosing whether use special optimized routine  or generic rountine. Feasible values are 1 or 3.

	- 0 : call generic rountine

	- 1 : call logistic loss rountine
	
	

- **lambda_coefficient**: Designed for special optimized routine. **Feasible range: [ 0, infinity )**, the **lambda** in aimed optimization problem would be **lambda coefficient / number of samples**, where the number of sample is data file's sample set size.

- **lambda**: Set lambda in aimed optimization problem. Complementary for lambda coefficient. **Feasible range: [ 0, infinity )**. If lambda is nonnegative, then FaRSA would ignore lambda coefficient, otherwise FaRSA would use lambda coefficient to calculate lambda.

- **data_file**: Necessary for special optimized routine, not required for generic routine. Provide absolute path to access data file. 

- **data_format**: Necessary for special optimized routine, not required for generic routine. Declare data file format. Current feasible values: libsvm. 


#### 2.2 Advanced Parameters

- **print_level**: print level, there are 4 print levels now:

	- 0: Print nothing
	
	- 1: Print summary information on terminal
	
	- 2: Output more detailed results into output file
	
	- 3: Print results as column format.


- **maximum_iteration**: Maximum iteration of FaRSA optimization algorithm. Feasible range: positive integer set. Default: 1000

- **Gamma**: Coefficient for switching between phi step or beta step. Feasible range: ( 0, 1 ]. Default: 1

- **eta_r**: Coefficient to determine target residual for conjugate gradient method. Feasible range: ( 0, 1 ]. Default: 0.1 

- **eta**: Coefficient in sufficient descrease. Feasible values: ( 0, 1 ]. Default: 0.01.

- **xi**: Shrinkage coefficient for backtracking line search. Feasible values: ( 0, 1 ]. Default: 0.5

- **tolerance**: Tolerance for termination. Feasible range: nonnegative float set. Suggest to set it from [ 1E-6, 1E-1 ]. Default: 1E-6.

- **beta_fraction**: Beta fraction to set the ratio of variables in beta step's calculation. Feasible range: ( 0, 1 ]. Default: 1.0

- **phi_fraction**: Phi fraction to set the ratio of variables in phi step's calculation. Feasible range: ( 0, 1 ]. Default: 1.0

- **max_CG_iter**: Maximum conjugate gradient method iteration. Feasible range: positive integer set. Default: 1000

- **TRradiusPhi**: Trust-region-like adaptive strategy radius for preventing the size of direction in reduced space solver from too large. Feasible range: positive float set. Default: 1000

- **TRradiusBeta**: Trust-region-like adaptive strategy radius for controlling the size of descent direction in beta step. Feasible range: 
positive float set. Default: 0.1

- **maxback**: Maximum allowed backtracking line search time. Feasible range: positive integer set. Default: 100

- **frac_viol**: Maximum allowed violating variable ratio for reduced space solver. Feasible range: [ 0, 1 ]. Default: 0.1. Real maximum allowed violating variable also depends on the next parameter: **nVmaxAllow**.

- **nV_max_allow**: The number of maximum allowed violating variable for reduced space solver. Feasible range: positive integer. Default: 1000. 

### 3 Data Set Prepration

Data set format that current FaRSA supports is libsvm format, which is suitable for sparse data set.  

**libsvm format** let each row represent each sample. The first entry of each row is the label of corresponding sample. Features with value as zero are ignored. Features with nonzero values are aligned as feature index, colon delimiter, feature value, as below:

	sample_1_label feature_1_idx:feature_1_value feature_2_idx:feature_2_value feature_5_idx:feature_5_value
	sample_2_label feature_2_idx:feature_2_value feature_3_idx:feature_3_value feature_4_idx:feature_4_value
	sample_3_label feature_1_idx:feature_1_value feature_3_idx:feature_3_value feature_5_idx:feature_5_value
	sample_4_label feature_1_idx:feature_1_value feature_3_idx:feature_3_value feature_5_idx:feature_5_value
	...


### 4 Construct Personalized Problem

FaRSA's generic routine can support any l1-regularized convex optimization problem. This attractive feature allows users to design their own objective function, instead of being limited by the problems in special optimized routine. To achieve calling generic routine, users are required to fill in **structure Input_FaRSA** to let FaRSA understand what the personalized objective function is.

```
struct Input_FaRSA{
	int n;
	double ( *func )( double * );
	double *( *grad_f )( double * );
	double *( *hessVec )( double * );
};

```

In general, there are three functions to be implemented:

- A function to calculate objective function value given current x

- A function to calculate gradient of f that is objecitve function without l1-regularized term given current x.

- A function to calculate reduced hessian vector product given a vector. 




#### 4.1 Function To Caculate Objecitve Function Value Given Current x

The template of this function is the following:

```
double personalized_func( double *x ){

	double func = 0.0;
	
	/*  Users fill in based on aimed problem */
	
	return func;
}

```



#### 4.2 Function To Caculate Gradient Of f Given Current x

The template of this function is as below:

```
double *personalized_grad_f( double *x ){

	double *grad_f;
	
	/* Users fill in based on aimed problem */
	
	return grad_f;
}

```
**Note:** f is the objective function without l1-regularization term. 


#### 4.3 Function To Calculate Reduced Hessian Vector Product Given A Vector.


The template is here:

```
double *personalized_hessVec( double *v ){

	double *hv;
	
	/*  
		Users fill in based on aimed problem
		Return reduced_hessian_matrix * v
		
	 */
	
	return hv;
}
```

To fill in the above template, three global variables maybe useful and can be directly used without any declaration: 

- **x**: A double pointer points to a double array to saves current **x**.

- **S**: A integer pointer points to a integer array that saves free variables' indexes at current **x**.

- **nS**: A integer save the number of free vairables in **S**.

#### 4.4 Set Input_FaRSA Structure

After implementing the above three functions, the next is to initialize Input_FaRSA Structure, asign these three functions to corresponding attributes of Input_RSA structure and set the rest  attribute **n** as the dimension of vairable **x** in the **main** function of **client.c**. For example,

```
int main( int argc, char **argv ){

	struct Input_FaRSA input_farsa;
	
	input_farsa.n = 10;
	input_farsa.func = &personalized_func;
	input_farsa.grad_f = &personalized_grad_f;
	input_farsa.hessVec = &personalized_hessVec;
	
	...

}	
```


### 5 Run FaRSA on Single Test Problem

After building profile and modifying client.c if necessary, we need to compile FaRSA one more time by

	make


**Note:** If there is **NO change** in **client.c**, then there is **no** need to complie FaRSA one more time if you have complied before.

Now, we are ready to run FaRSA to solve our aimed problems. Run the below command:

	./farsa -t path_to_profile

**Note:** path_to_profile is 

- The absolute path accesses to profile location or 

- The relative path to FaRSA source directory accesses to profile location.

Output will be displayed in terminal, like

```
$ ./farsa -p FaRSA1.profile
Dataset Description:
Number of samples : 19996
Number of features: 1355191
Logistic loss plus l1 regularizer...
Initial objective function value: 0.693147
Optimal solution has been found.
Objective function value: 0.323483
Iteration: 18
Error: 0.000001
Target tolerance: 0.000001
runtime: 3.333872s
```

### 6 Run FaRSA on A Buntch of Test Problems

If you want to run FaRSA on a buntch of test problems, the below is necessary:

- Provide profiles for each test problem. And save them in offered profiles directory

- For each profile, set printlevel as 3 

- Create a file to save the names of profile.

- Run the below command in farsa directory in terminal:

		bash runall.sh probfile.txt
